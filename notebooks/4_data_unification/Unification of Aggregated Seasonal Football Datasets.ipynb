    "\n",
    "<b>'Record linkage'</b> is the term used by statisticians, epidemiologists, and historians, among others, to describe the process of joining records from one data source with another that describe the same entity ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_linkage)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Record linkage is necessary when joining different data sets based on entities that may or may not share a common identifier (e.g., database key, URI, National identification number), which may be due to differences in record shape, storage location, or curator style or preference. A data set that has undergone RL-oriented reconciliation may be referred to as being cross-linked. Record linkage is referred to as data linkage in many jurisdictions, but the two are the same process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The toolkit provides most of the tools needed for record linkage and deduplication. The package contains indexing methods, functions to compare records and classifiers. The package is developed for research and the linking of small or medium sized files.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a full guide on how to use record linkage, see the official documentation [here](https://recordlinkage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and also this worked example by [Chris Moffitt](https://twitter.com/chris1610) at the following [[link](https://pbpython.com/record-linking.html)]."
