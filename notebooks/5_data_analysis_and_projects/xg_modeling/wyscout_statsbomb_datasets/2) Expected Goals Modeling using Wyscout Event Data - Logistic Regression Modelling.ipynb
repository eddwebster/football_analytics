    "Three commonly used metrics for measuring the performance of a model are:\n",
    "*    <b>Accuracy</b> - measures the share of right and wrong decisions and does not take into consideration at all the certainty of a decision, whether you are 51% sure or 99% sure. When having unbalanced data, i.e. on outcome happens way more often than the other, it is very simple to get a good accuracy. All you need to do is to just always predict the outcome that is more likely. For this reason, Accuracy is an inappropriate metric for this model.\n",
    "*    <b>Log loss</b> - when predicting probabilities the metric you should always look at is the log loss (also called binary cross entropy). As this model looks at the probability with which a goal is scored, this is an appropriate metric to assess this model.\n",
    "*    <b>ROC AUC</b> (or AUC) - constructed using false positive rates and true positive rates with different thresholds etc. The AUC of a model is the probability that the model ranks a random positive example (i.e. a successful shot) more highly than a random negative example (i.e. unsuccessful shot). The problem with measuring the AUC of a xG model is that it only looks at ranking of the positive vs. the negative examples and not about the probabilities that are assigned to the examples. We, however, are interested in knowing the probability of a shot being successful. This is not captured by the AUC. The AUC however can help  communicate results to non data scientists. This notebook focusses on improving the log loss during model development, but using the AUC, we are able to say that the model has \"It has a 77% chance of detecting the successful shot from the unsuccessful one\", which is more understandable to non Data Scientists such as \"the model has a log loss of 0.306\"."

    "There are data points far away from the goal that almost certainly wrong, the other might indeed have happened in a match and are therefore right. However, when e.g. looking at the cell in the right midfield: There was one shot and that shot went in. Assuming this situation indeed happened, there was most likely either no goalie or the goalie was extremely badly positioned. The attacker saw this and therefore decided to shoot but would have never shot otherwise. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data is required to be smooth so that the model doesn't think there's a 50% chance of scoring when shooting from the right midfield or from an acute angle to the left of the goalkeeper, outside the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three options:\n",
    "1.    Delete the outliers;\n",
    "2.    Use our experience and tell the model that the probability to score from this position is realistically 0. This means we change the target but leave the features as is; and\n",
    "3.    Assume that the shot happened closer to the goal, but we still assume that it went in. This means that we change the features but leave the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are more sophisticated ways to filter out these shots such as determining the percentage likelyhood of shooting from a position on the filter, and setting the chance to score to 0 if the player will 99 times out of 100, pass instead of shoot from that position. With this logic, we can assume that all shots happening in any of the cells with < 1% shooting probability did not result in a goal. This is an approach applied by Kraus Clemens ([@CleKraus](https://twitter.com/CleKraus)) in his Logistic Regression xG notebook [[link](https://github.com/eddwebster/soccer_analytics/blob/master/notebooks/expected_goal_model_lr.ipynb)].\n",
