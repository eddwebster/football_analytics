We ask that you provide a description of the method that you chose, including any metrics and plots that you have used to understand and assess the performance of your model.

Using the data for sample game 2 in the repository, identify the shots in this game and write a short report describing the major chances that each team created during the game, making use of the chance quality model that you developed in Step 1 and any other information that you think is relevant. Based solely on the quality of chances that each team created, which team do you think deserved to win the game?

    "\n",
    "#### Expected Goals Models\n",
    "*    The focus of my approach to answer this data challenge was to not build the absolute best performing ML model, with the best performance metrics and fanciest algorithm. My objective was to conduct and end-to-end process for building a model, including all the key stages such as feature engineering, univariate and multivariate analysis, and iterated performance assessment and improvement – for this reason, for the submission of the data task, a simple Chance Quality Model was built using Logistic Regression. However, Gradient Boosting algorithms lead to improved performance and for this reason, this second notebook (of currently two) creates a Chance Quality Model using [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Potential further models that can be deployed to try and further improve the performance of the Chance Quality model include other Gradient Boosting algorithms, such as [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [Catboost](https://catboost.ai/). More detail about these modeling approaches can be found in my the Data Science pack that I submitted as part of my initial application (see: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16stYbJoI8aYqtn_grJHSdTbMA1xwo-Iy9g9JJruMOBQ/edit?usp=sharing). \n",
    "\n",
    "*    Application of a full Event data set, such as those from StatsBomb and Wyscout, to create an Expected Goals model with more features. Such features that were not possible to include in this model but that could be added with Event and/or Tracking data include: strong/weak foot, flag for counter attack, flag for smart pass, determine whether a shot had been immediately taken before, whether the shot was from a cross. This is discussed in more detail in the Feature Engineering section (section 9) of the first Chance Quality Model notebook [[link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/eddwebster/mcfc_submission/blob/main/notebooks/chance_quality_modelling/Creating%20a%20Chance%20Quality%20Model%20from%20Shots%20Data.ipynb)]. A comparison of the features used in the respected xG models by [Sam Green](https://twitter.com/aSamGreen) and [Michael Caley](https://twitter.com/MC_of_A) can be found in the index.\n",
    "\n",
    "*    To see really test the performance of this model, it would be great to quality test performance and xG prediction with those of other providers such as StatsBomb and observe the level of variance in predictions between this basic model and a professional one created using a much larger dataset with much more features.\n",
    "\n",
    "*    Creation of separate Expected Goals models for Direct Free Kicks and Corners. Currently, only Open-Play shots considered and a xG value for penalties was taken from StatsBomb/FBref [[link](https://fbref.com/en/expected-goals-model-explained/)]. \n",
    "\n",
    "*    Add fake shots to the shots data – see David Sumpter’s tweet for the benefits of including fake data in an Expected Goals model [[link](https://twitter.com/Soccermatics/status/1260598182624575490)].\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tracking data\n",
    "*    This current analysis only focuses on the shots taken by the teams. The next stage of this analysis would be to apply this Tracking data, not to just a Shots dataset, but to a full Events dataset, taking the basic concepts of analysis and feature extraction observed in this submission and then start to apply more sophisticated modeling approaches such as Pitch Control or Expected Possession Value (EPV) models such as the VAEP model by SciSports and KULeuven, or the Expected Threat (xT) model by Karun Singh. This can be taken on further, by combining these two modelling approaches to analyse value that certain actions of interest brought to the team during a particular play in the match and determine the Expected Value-Added. This was unfortunately not possible to do in this analysis as the Event data provided only included Shot data, but it would be something I would like to take on and do in the future, using publicly available Event data from StatsBomb and Wyscout, with the sample Tracking data from Metrica Sports. More detail about these models can be found in my the Data Science pack that I submitted in my initial application (see: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16stYbJoI8aYqtn_grJHSdTbMA1xwo-Iy9g9JJruMOBQ/edit?usp=sharing). \n",
    "\n",
    "*    Further enrich the Event data through Tracking data, adding further detail and specificity, which again can be used to further improve the Expected Goals model. This was observed in this analysis with addition of the Intervening and Interfering teammates and opponents. Features that were not considered in this analysis, include aspects such as the goalkeeper and defender positions in the moment of the shot e.g.: how much of the goal was covered by the goalkeeper? are the defenders in position? These are attributes that can be derived from the Tracking data to gain additional insight previously not possible."
